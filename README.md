# Installation

$ npm install

Running this command created a node_modules/ directory with all dependent modules available.
After doing this you can build the source code or run the tests.

# Build files

$ npm run build

Source code resides in the src/ directory and is written in TypeScript and files end with .ts.
After building a dist/ directory is created with javascript files which can be used to run the installation.

# Run installation

$ npm start

You can now open a browser and point it to http://localhost:3000/

# Run unit tests

$ npm test

Tests are located in the test/ directory and typically end with .test.ts
